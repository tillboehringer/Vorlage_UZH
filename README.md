# Vorlage_UZH

This is a LaTex-template for physik-papers (can also be used for other papers) with the logos from the University of Zurich. (not official)

## Changing the logo and stuff

If the Language is set to German (ngerman in the Babel-package), it uses the German logo, for all other languages, it uses the English logo.

The Logo can be changed under “Setup/Logos/PDF“. The name of the Logo-file must also be chanced under “Setup/settings.sty" line 15.

## The different Branches

On the master-branch should always be a stable version, on the development-branch could be something in the works, which is not stable or does not function properly.
